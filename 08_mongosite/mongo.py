"""
The data set we have used is movies and it contains:
- titles of movies
	- year
	- cast 
	- genres 

This dataset is hosted https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data/master/movies.json

Our import mechanism is to get the json file and read the file. We then use 
the json.load() in order to decode the data and then insert that into the db 
collection we have initialized.
